  "summary": "I am a recent graduate from George Brown College's Wireless Networking program. This program covered programming theory, practical applications, computer networking concepts and applications, and systems design. I have four years of technical working experience as a Junior Engineer.  My primary responsibilities include PLC-SCADA programming and Team Collaboration, these helped me boost my communication and leadership skills. Between my education and my work experience, I have built up a wide knowledge base and learned how to quickly teach myself new concepts, which I believe makes me a perfect fit for the Data Engineering industry. I'm also interested in the potential crossover between Data Engineering and other fields, both inside and outside the IT sphere, since a little external domain knowledge can go a long way in creating new solutions. I am working as a Data Engineer at Jarvis. I have familiarized myself with the core concepts of the subject and have gained valuable practice in using software that is prevalent in the industry."

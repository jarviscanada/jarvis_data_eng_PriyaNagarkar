# Priya Nagarkar . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from George Brown College's Wireless Networking program. This program covered programming theory, practical applications, computer networking concepts and applications, and systems design. I have four years of technical working experience as a Junior Engineer.  My primary responsibilities include PLC-SCADA programming and Team Collaboration, these helped me boost my communication and leadership skills. Between my education and my work experience, I have built up a wide knowledge base and learned how to quickly teach myself new concepts, which I believe makes me a perfect fit for the Data Engineering industry. I'm also interested in the potential crossover between Data Engineering and other fields, both inside and outside the IT sphere, since a little external domain knowledge can go a long way in creating new solutions. I am working as a Data Engineer at Jarvis. I have familiarized myself with the core concepts of the subject and have gained valuable practice in using software that is prevalent in the industry.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Priya](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Priya)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Priya/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a Linux cluster monitoring agent that records the hardware specification of each host machine and monitors their memory usage in real-time. The project was primarily developed using bash scripts that are integrated with the PostgreSQL database. Using Docker for containerization, the end product is light-weight, versatile, and easy to use.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Priya/tree/master/core_java)]: Grep App -Utilizes the Stream API and Lambda expressions to replicate the grep command used in bash within Java. JDBC App - Initiated the use of JDBC and design patterns such as DAOs. Twitter App - Works with the Twitter API to allow simple CRUD operations. The project follows the MVC architecture and is tested with JUnit and Mockito

**Python Data Analytics** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_Priya/tree/master/python_data_anlytics)]: Data analytics on Sales data via using Python, JupyterNotebook, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and so on. The project contains two parts, the data warehouse and notebook. Docker deploys them both separately. The JupyterNotebook analytics and visualize the monthly growth and the distribution of different customers. Also, used RFM and segmentations to the group and tag customers to analyze the target group and digging some potential marketing.


## Highlighted Projects
**ITIL**: Designed setup for International students helping them to find basic necessities options at one place. Established 5 lifecycle stages and guidelines for successful implementation.

**IPSEC **: Blocked attack from one virtual machine to another using Kali.

**Azure**: Designed web application using Ansible and installed SIEM server to monitor same.

**Cisco packet Tracer**: Network design and implementation of college. Network allocation to different cluster

**Python**: This project will help user find a solution to any solvable Sudoku puzzle using backtracking algorithm.

**Visual basic**:  Designed library management system, to track book records including books given, books received, deadline to receive and fine charged for late submission.

**Microcontroller**:  Designed a system which studies and sense soil moisture. According to the reading it will turn water sprinkler on and off.

**Matlab**:  Developed a program in matlab using image capturing technology, to monitor and capture traffic signs. It detects and recognizes traffic signs well in advance and provide output to driver. I used Support Vector Machine and Histogram of Oriented Gradients in this project.
